## 300 gallon to 90 gallon conversion
Currently many areas of the South Side are serviced by shared 300 gallon containers in the alley. The City of Columbus is planning to convert all existing shared 300 gallon containers to individual 90 gallon container collection by the end of 2024.

# Litter
During July 2023, refuse collection employees completed litter indexing while navigating their normal routes. Indexing is broken down into four scores:

- Little to No Litter - Virtually no litter was observed on the street. There may be one or two small items in the vicinity. The street has a generally neat and tidy appearance.
- Slightly Littered - Litter is prevalent in moderate amounts.
- Littered - Considerable amount of litter is prevalent. An organized effort for rmoval is required with considerable cleanup of the street segment.
- Extremely Littered - An excessive amount of litter is prevalent. Illegal dumpsites may be observed. Equipment may be required for cleanup.
