# Crosswalks

## Additional crosswalk enhancements are coming
The City of Columbus Department of Public Service is moving forward with the design of enhancements to crosswalks at the following intersections along Parsons Avenue in the South Side Area Commission boundaries:

- Deshler Avenue
- Kossuth Street
- Columbus Street
- Moler Street

Enhancements are also planned at the intersection of Parsons Avenue and Harland Drive within the Far South Area Commission boundaries.

The City has not yet identified funding for these improvements. 

This page will be updated as we find out more about the planned improvements and the potential timeline for their installation.
