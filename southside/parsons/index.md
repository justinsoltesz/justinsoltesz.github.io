# Crosswalks

## Additional crosswalk enhancements are coming
The City of Columbus Department of Public Service is moving forward with the design of enhancements to crosswalks at the following intersections along Parsons Avenue in the South Side Area Commission boundaries:

- **Deshler Avenue**: [Pedestrian hyrbid beacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89lKaZLXZCU), curb extension, and high-visibility crosswalk markings on the north side of the intersection
- **Kossuth Street**: Curb extension and high-visibility crosswalk markings on the north side of the intersection
- **Columbus Street**: Curb extension and high-visibility crosswalk markings on the south side of the intersection
- **Moler Street**: Curb extension and high-visibility crosswalk markings on the north side of the intersection

At the intersection of Parsons Avenue and Harland Drive within the Far South Area Commission boundaries, a [Rectangular Rapid-Flashing Beacon (RRFB)](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/proven-safety-countermeasures/rectangular-rapid-flashing-beacons-rrfb) with high-visibility crosswalk markings is planned.

Funding and potential timeline for construction is still to be determined.
