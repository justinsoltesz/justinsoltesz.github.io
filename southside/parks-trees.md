# Parks Improvements 
In 2019, the Public Services Committee visited every park on the South Side and made a list of maintenance needs as well as recommended improvements. Since then, the City's Recreation and Parks Department has worked to address the issues and make improvements. 

*More information coming soon...*

# Street Trees
The South Side's tree canopy is estimated at 18%, below the Citywide average of 22% and well below the City's goal of 40%. Investment in the South Side's tree canopy, especially with the installation of street trees, is a priority.

## Urban Forestry Master Plan
The Urban Forestry Master Plan (UFMP) is a strategic and long-term investment in Columbusâ€™ tree canopy. The South Side has been identified as a priority neighborhood for investment.
