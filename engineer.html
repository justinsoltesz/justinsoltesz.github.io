		<h3>Past Experience</h3>
		<h4>Burgess &amp; Niple</h4>
		<p>I spent January to August 2014 and January to August 2015 as a transportation engineering co-op assiting in the development of construction plans for local roadway and high projects with Burgess &amp; Niple in Columbus, OH. This included working on a wide variety of projects, especially in Ohio.</p>
		<h4>Academic Projects</h4>
		<p><strong>Grove City Shared-use Path:</strong> Our project team studied possible means of connecting Fryer Park to Mount Carmel facility in Grove City, Ohio, which included providing a crossing of I-71. Investigated right-of-way, quality of connection, cost, permitting, environmental and floodplain impacts, and maintenance of traffic and traffic impacts. Included oral presentation and final report of findings.</p>
		<p><strong>4th Street Exit from I-670:</strong> Our project team is currently studying possible realignments of the 4th Street exit from I-670 west just north of Downtown Columbus. The project's goal is to slow traffic on 4th Street, especially the traffic coming off of I-670, as significant residential development is occurring in the area.</p>
